// ONE OWNER of a state -- the cube's, Ad Hoc Analysis mode's grid (docs/DATACUBE_LEG_B_STATE_OWNER_2026_09_28.md,
// Leg B). What makes a state a kind of state is its `StateRules` (cube-state.ts has the cube's,
// adhoc/session.ts Ad Hoc's); the transaction rules are these, the same for every kind.
//
// A state lives HERE and nowhere else, as one immutable value in three places:
//
//   committed  the last state the user's actions produced and the engine ACCEPTED, as the
//              engine returned it (`StateRules.land`)
//   rendered   the state of the view on screen; differs from committed only while a query runs
//   pending    the change in flight, if any
//
// Presentation paints `current` (pending ?? committed); anything read off the rows on screen
// reads `rendered`.
//
// Two kinds of change, told apart by the QUERY itself, never by a list of settings: a change
// whose state folds to the same query (`queryKey`) is PRESENTATION -- colours, widths,
// formats, labels -- and commits at once, with no query, and cannot be refused. Anything else
// is a TRANSACTION:
//
//   success     committed = rendered = the state the engine returned; one undo step if the
//               change was the user's; one `committed` event
//   refusal     the pending state is dropped and everything repaints from `committed`; a change
//               made on top of another still pending reverts BOTH, and says which
//   superseded  a newer change owns the cube: this one is dropped quietly (latest wins)
//
// Undo and redo are transactions over a stack of committed states that MOVES ONLY WHEN THE
// MOVE LANDS: an undo refused or overtaken leaves the stacks as they were. Undo while a change
// is in flight cancels that change -- the one thing the user just did -- and nothing more; undo
// while an undo is in flight goes one step further (two presses, two steps). A change made on
// top of an undo in flight lands as that undo AND the change, one step each.
//
// No DOM, no engine: the query runs through `run`, so every rule here is proven by fast tests
// (test/cube-state.test.ts, over the cube's rules and a toy state's).
