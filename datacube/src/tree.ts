// Kept pure and separate from both the grid and the engine, because
// this is where pivot tables usually rot. Two decisions matter:
//
//  - Expansion is keyed by group IDENTITY, never by row position. A
//    refresh, a re-sort or a filter change renumbers every row, so
//    position-keyed state silently opens the wrong groups. Identity
//    keying is why "state survives refresh" is a property rather than
//    a hope, and it is the documented cause of a whole class of
//    complaints in other products.
//  - A subtotal is the SAME measure expression with a grouping column
//    dropped -- never a second aggregation pass. That makes "the
//    subtotal disagrees with the detail", the single most-reported
//    pivot defect, structurally impossible rather than merely tested
//    against.
