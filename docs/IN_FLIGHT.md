# In flight

**Start at `docs/EXECUTION_PLAN_2026_09_26.md` §0.** It holds the current item ("Now"), the session checklist, the
decisions and the order. This file only says who is working and what rules apply between sessions; it carries no status
of its own (plan rule 0b.16).

- **One session owns the whole repository** (since 2026-09-29; the user stopped every other session). The two-session
  handshake that lived here is retired; its text is in git history at `caf0cf71f`.
- **The compiler rebuild lands on `main`** slice by slice (D18): each slice is gated by `bazel test //...` and `bazel test
  //tools/deps:all` on the exact tree, then pushed with `git push origin HEAD:compiler/rebuild HEAD:main`.
- **Paused while the rebuild runs:** `docs/SERVER_PROGRAM_2026_09_26.md` (its legs are SV0–SV3, not the rebuild's W0–W7),
  the DataCube feature programs (`docs/DATACUBE_*`), NLQ (the untracked `nlq/` directory is not ours; leave it).

## A second line, 2026-09-29: DataCube against the warehouse (the user's ask, rule 5)

In the worktree `legend-lite-dcsnap`, branch `datacube-live-snap`. **Owns:** `datacube/`. **Touches `warehouse/`** (one
line each, announced here before landing):
- `server/Identity.java`, `server/WarehouseServer.java`: `POST /sql/v1/token/refresh` (a valid token for a fresh one,
  never past the sign-in's session limit, 12h default); tokens carry their sign-in time (`principal|expiry|signedInAt`);
  `--token-key-file` (a key kept across restarts), `--token-minutes`, `--session-hours`; `Config.sessionLimit`.
- `server/Statements.java` (+ `Identity.hasUser`): a GRANT must name an object (or schema) that exists and a
  grantee (or role member) who is a user or role; REVOKE stays open. Test:
  `WarehouseEntitlementsTest.aGrantNamesSomethingThatIsThereForSomeoneWhoIs`.
- `sqlapi/SqlApiBinding.java`, `sqlapi/NativeBinding.java`: `refresh(token)`. Tests: `IdentityTest` (new),
  `WarehouseServerTest.aValidTokenRefreshesAndTheFreshOneWorks`.

**Touches CI** (`.github/workflows/gates-run.yml`, `gate.yml`): a `browser` lane, Linux only --
`//datacube:live_snap_test` and the `browser-ci` harnesses; the other lanes unchanged. `docs/GATES.md`: its row.

Nothing in `core/`, `spec/`, `tools/`. Runs a warehouse (`:9090`) and the DataCube site (`:8000`), idle: stop them before
a timing (rule 4).

## A third line, 2026-09-30: DataCube track A and the BI plan (the user's ask, rule 5)

`docs/BI_AND_ETL_PLAN_2026_09_29.md`; the user: "start track A now, and go in the suggested order for everything that does
not need any server side work". **Owns:** `datacube/` (and its CI lane). No edit in `core/`, `spec/`, `tools/` or
`warehouse/`; the plan's server-side items (F1 write, F2's resolver, F4, F5, unpivot) wait for the rebuild's say (§8).

**2026-10-01, announced before landing (rule 5): a cross-area edit in `core/`** (the user: "announce it and do
it"). So a file opened in DataCube's tab has its model written WITHOUT the WebAssembly module, on any planner (legend-engine
included), and the writer cannot drift from the compiler's:
- STRUCTURED, no type string parsed (the user: "do the homework first of how to do this CORRECTLY in structured form"):
  `DuckDb.CATALOG_COLUMNS_SQL` reads a table's columns from `duckdb_columns()` joined on the type id to
  `duckdb_types()` -- each column's canonical type, and a DECIMAL's precision and scale as numbers. `catalogType` is
  data over that (`CATALOG_TYPES`, `CATALOG_ALIASES` for JSON, `CATALOG_REFUSED` with reasons); the regexes are gone.
  `CatalogModel.Column` CHANGED: `(name, dataType, logicalType, precision, scale)`. `CatalogModelTest` reads real
  DuckDB tables, and a completeness test fails on a canonical type with no decision.
- Callers moved with it: `wasm/.../Wasm.java` `databaseFromCatalogOrError` takes the structured column; the warehouse's
  `/sql/v1/catalogs/{c}/objects` adds `logicalType`, `precision`, `scale` to each column (`type` kept).
- `datacube/tools/catalogfacts/` generates `datacube/src/generated/catalog-facts.ts` (the tables and the catalog
  question) and `datacube/test/generated/catalog-corpus.ts` (what `CatalogModel.database` answers for real DuckDB
  tables); `datacube/src/catalog-model.ts` is DataCube's writer, tested against the corpus case for case.
  `WasmPlanner.databaseFromCatalog` is kept (its input is now the structured column); DataCube no longer calls it.

**2026-10-01, announced before landing (rule 5): a cross-area edit in `core/`** (the user: "i think we should fix calc
column"). legend-engine refused 13 DataCube features that legend-lite passes; one cause is legend-lite's own leniency:
- `core/.../compiler/spec/Typer.java` `collection`: a literal of more than one value requires each element to be exactly
  `[1]`, as legend-engine (`ValueSpecificationBuilder.visit(Collection)`) and legend-pure (`InstanceValueValidator`) do.
  `$x.notional * 1.1` over a nullable column is then refused, as on engine (write `->toOne()`). This reverts the
  2026-09-11 loosening (`MULTIPLICITY_AUDIT_2026_08_20.md` §4a), whose premise "real pure accepts it" legend-pure's
  source contradicts; `MultiplicityStrictnessTest` flips back to expecting the refusal.
- NOT changed in `core/` (the user: engine's gaps are compensated in DataCube and recorded, not "fixed" in legend-lite):
  `over(String[*], SortInfo[*], Frame[0..1])` (in engine's over.pure, never registered by its Handlers.java) and BIT
  typed Boolean (engine's RelationalCompilerExtension says TinyInt; legend-pure says Boolean). Both get register rows.

## Rules between sessions

1. Never force-push; never bare `git stash` (the stash stack is shared by every worktree).
2. Before pushing, `git fetch origin`; `main` must fast-forward.
3. The gate chain is `bazel test //...` then `bazel test //tools/deps:all`; `//parser-equivalence:diagnostics` runs only on
   its triggers (a pin bump, a parser/lexer/protocol change, a corpus manifest change).
4. A timing is a lane run alone with `--nocache_test_results`, load under 3 at the start, nothing else building.
5. If a second line of work starts again, this file becomes the handshake again: each side's owned area, cross-area edits
   announced one line each before they land, and dated status lines.
